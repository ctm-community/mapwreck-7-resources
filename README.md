# Getting the Resourcepack

##### If you just want to download it once, you can get it by going to Code > Download as Zip


##### If you want to be able to update it live as people add to it here's how:

### 1. Install and set up Github Desktop: https://desktop.github.com/

### 2. Clone the repository to your .minecraft\resourcepacks folder: Code > Open with Github Desktop > Clone
   IMPORTANT: the repository path should be .minecraft\resourcepacks\mapwreck-7-resources (make sure there isn't an additional folder)

### 3. Once you've successfully cloned the repository, you can normally apply the resourcepack from Minecraft.
   To update it as people add things, click on fetch origin and press f3 + T in-game.

# Contributing to the Resourcepack

### 1. Clone the repository (instructions above)

### 2. Add your item textures to the folder inside of an assets that matches your area. If there isn't one, add and name one appprpriately. Once you've finished, commit your changes and push to origin.
   As of 1.19.4, mojang made it a real hell to collab on custom textures live because of atlases. Due to this if you want a custom item texture added and don't know how to work the atlas, place it in the resourcepack and message @RockNRed#0001 with the item type and custom model data number. Unless specified you need it during the event, these will be added on compile.
   If you want to make a change to something vanilla, please ask an organizer before doing so.
